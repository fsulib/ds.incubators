# Digital Project Development Toolkit - FSU Library
This is the repository for FSU's Project Development Toolkit. It originates from the "Managing Scope and Scale: Applying the Incubator Model to Digital Scholarship" repository, presented at DLF 2016. The following repositories contain information on digital project incubators from that presentation:
* FSU PEN & Inc (FSU Libraries, Sarah Stanley & Micah Vandegrift)
* UCLA DResSUP (UCLA Libraries, Zoe Borovsky & Dawn Childress)
* UNL (University of Nebraska, Lincoln Libraries, Liz Lorang)
* docs (which contains the landing page for the presentation

Other folders will be added which contain FSU's processes and workflows for taking on and managing new projects. Check back again soon!
